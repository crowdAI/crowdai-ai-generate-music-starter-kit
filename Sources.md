This list will be constantly updated. And you are welcome to send a pull request to [https://github.com/crowdAI/crowdai-ai-generate-music-starter-kit](https://github.com/crowdAI/crowdai-ai-generate-music-starter-kit) with any other datasets that you find useful.
The participants are free to use any publicly available dataset of MIDI files.
The only constraint is the output of their models should be single track MIDI files, and the evaluation interface will use an Acoustic Grand Piano [SoundFont](https://github.com/mudcube/MIDI.js/blob/master/examples/soundfont/acoustic_grand_piano-mp3.js) to play the same.
